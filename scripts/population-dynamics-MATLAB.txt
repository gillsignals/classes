%Make a plot to look at your results

ylabel('Population Size')

%Note that with the logistic model and a time lag you get multiple growth
%rate values for the same population size (which makes sense, because

%the population's growth rate depends both on its current size, and on

%its size at some past time point). This results in some pretty spirals...



figure(2)
plot(population,dNdt) 
%This plot is basically the derivative of the upper

    %panel. It is useful if you want to show that the growth rate of a

    %population depends upon its size. And, if you have a logistic model

    %with no time lags, it gives a nice demonstration of why MSY

    %(maximum sustainable yield, a fisheries concept) is at K/2.

ylabel('Growth Rate')


   

figure(3)

plot(population,dNdt./population)

     %This plot allows us to see that the density

     %dependence of the growth rate varies with growth model. In exponential

      %growth, per capita reproduction (dNdt/N) is a constant (r). In

     %logistic growth, per capita reproductive rate decreases with

     %increasing population density.

DISCUSSION
%Initial parameters N0=1 r=.1 K=100 t=200
%With a time delay, the value of the current population size N, its
%growth rate and its per capita growth rate all depend on the past values of
%N. Experimenting with a range of parameters...initial parameters but changing
% tau to 2, 5, 10, 20 - 3 is pretty much logistic, 5 slightly overshoots K but
%then comes back quickly, for 10 N oscillates slightly around K with decreasing
%amplitude converging to K and growth rate and per capita growth rate spiral
%and converge to K, 20 is a ridiculous continuous loop for growth rate and
%population growth rate and N oscillates stably between 1 and nearly 3N with
%a period of 100 generations when initial growth rate  r=.1

%Consider these 3 scenarios associated with lag times.

%Lag time 3 - In a geographically secluded valley, a small herd of elephants
%multiplies slowly at first, increasing in numbers more rapidly as their larger
%herd expands into new, fertile parts of the valley. As the herd fills all
%available grazing areas, their numbers level off.

%Lag time 10 - A small flock of birds is transported by a storm to an island with
%no native bird population and plentiful prey. Their population explodes, but quickly
%drops as they lower the population of their prey. As the prey bounce back, so do the
%birds, gradually reaching a new equilibrium population size.

%Lag time 20 - The wolf population of a particular forest stably oscillates based on
%the rabbit population. In one phase the rabbit population rises sharply due to
%plentiful vegetation growth. The next it plummets as wolf populations rise and prey
%upon them. Then the wolf population declines somewhat due to prey scarcity, allowing
%the rabbit population to rise again.

NOTE: Population models that do not explicitly incorporate lag times can also display oscillations. It's not necessary to add a time lag to a model equation when oscillation is observed in data.
